<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, Welcome to My Wallet</h1>
<h3 align="center">A simple wallet application for the Android platform.</h3>

# Wallet App
This is an Android application developed using Kotlin, Android SDK, Retrofit 2.x.x, Hilt DI, and
MVVM architecture. The app consists of two fragments - page1 and page2 - implemented using the
Android Navigation component. The app also features a username filter logic to ensure that users
input their username correctly, as well as balance input validation to avoid insufficient balance
errors.

# Features
The following features were implemented in the Send Fund App:

# Page1: Login
- Username filter logic: The app allows users to input their username using only letters (a-z),
numbers (0-9), full stop (.), and underscore (_). The username must be between 3 to 32 characters
long, and the user cannot input successive underscores or full stops. The app also converts any
uppercase letters to lowercase letters.
- PIN input field: After the user inputs their username, the PIN input field is automatically enabled
after waiting for 2 seconds from the user's last character input.
- Continue button: The continue button is enabled only after the user inputs a valid username.

# Page2: Send Fund
- Call "login" API: After a successful response from the login API, the app takes the user to page2.
- WalletAddress in Recipient card: The app sets the user's username (WalletAddress) on the recipient
card.
- Max button: The app allows the user to click on the max button to set the balance amount.
- Balance USDC: The app shows the user's balance in USDC after deducting the input value. The input
value must be within the use case accuracy.
- Insufficient balance: If the user inputs an amount greater than their balance, the app shows an "
Insufficient balance" message.
- Add fund button: If the user inputs an amount greater than their balance, the app shows an "Add
fund" button. However, this button doesn't have any action at this phase.

# Technology Stack

- Language: Kotlin
- SDK: Android SDK
- Navigation Graph: Yes
- Single Activity Pattern: Yes
- Network Operation: Retrofit 2.x.x
- Dependency Injection: Hilt
- Architecture: MVVM

This technology stack is used for developing Android applications. Kotlin is the primary language
used for coding while the Android SDK provides the necessary tools and libraries to build Android
applications. The Navigation Graph is utilized for efficient navigation between different screens in
the application, while the Single Activity Pattern provides a streamlined and efficient approach to
designing the app's structure.

Retrofit 2.x.x is used for network operations, providing a robust and reliable way to communicate
with remote servers. Hilt is utilized for dependency injection, allowing for easier management and
organization of app components. Finally, the MVVM architecture pattern is utilized to maintain a
clean and modular architecture for the app.

# Conclusion
The Send Fund App is a fully functional Android application that implements the features required in
the PRD document. The app is implemented using Kotlin and adheres to the MVVM architecture, making
it easy to maintain and expand.
